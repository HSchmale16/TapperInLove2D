# Tapper Clone In Love2D

Inpsired by the bar arcade game cause I was having a lot
of fun with it up on a work trip,
and felt like I could implement it in a weekend.

# How To Run

1. Install a copy of love from https://love2d.org/
2. Make sure love is on your $PATH
3. Clone this repo.
4. In this directory open a terminal, and type `love .`
